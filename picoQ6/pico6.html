      <h2>Challenge Description</h2>
      <p>The Network Operations Center (NOC) of your local institution picked up a suspicious file, they're getting 
        conflicting information on what type of file it is. They've brought you in as an external expert to examine 
        the file. Can you extract all the information from this strange file? Download the suspicious file here.  </p>

  <h2>Writeup Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    
    <li>
      After downloaded the file, it shows that it's a suspicious file with just half of the flag
      <div class="img-box">
        <img src="Q6_1.png" alt="file">
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      At first, I use binwalk to check if there's embedded data and extracted them.
      <div class="img-box">
        <img src="Q6_2.png" alt="Binwalk to check the file">
        <p>Yes, there is. A weird thing is, it shows that there's file with png, pdf and zlib extension in this pdf file</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      Then, I direct to the folder that has the extracted file, and i read them
      <div class="img-box">
        <img src="Q6_3.png" alt="extracted file">
        <p>both 47D and 47D.zlib give the same output, which is the half of the flag that shown in pdf before.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      As previously, we did mention that, there's a png extension when we check with binwalk. Hence, I check its file type. 
      
      <div class="img-box">
        <img src="Q6_4.png" alt="not pdf file">
        <p>And look, this is not a pdf file, but it's a png file!</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      I change the file's extension from pdf to png, then open the .png file 
      <div class="img-box">
        <img src="Q6_5.png" alt="is png file">
        <img src="Q6_6.png" alt="flag">
        <p>Yay, we got another half!</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    
  </ol>
